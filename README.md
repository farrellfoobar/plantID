Right now this github contains everything that should exist in your plantID file in android studio.
Once you have downloaded android studio and played arround with it a little you can clone this repository into a file and import it as a project within andriod studio.

The actual files we are going to be working with are located in "Java > uci.plantID" and "layout". The files in the layout tab define how the app looks and feels. At the bottom of the edit window you can switch bettween the acual text of the XML and how the design will look in the app. All the XML files do is change how the app looks and give us elements the user can interact with. The interactable elements will call methods in one of the Java class files, which is how we do all the back end work. You can see how this works with the Next button on the first page.
